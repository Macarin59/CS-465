**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA)**

Various frontend development tools were used in this project. Express was used for the public facing webpage to allow for dynamic webpage creation which empowers the Angular Single-Page Application (SPA) Admin tool. Express alongside Handlebars allows for simple code injection into html. 
The SPA allows for a simple and reliable single page for adminstrators to add and adjust trip information. Lastly, JavaScript is the backbone of the project and exists throughout the front and back end allowing for numerous interactions between various development tools.

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**

The backend used MongoDB because of the allows for easy modification of schema and its non-relational nature.

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**

JSON is a standard filetype for storing object data that is convertable into JavaScript if needed but does not necessarily need to be read as JavaScript which makes it extremely versitile as a method of storing data. 
This versitility allows for usage of JSON information throughout the front and back end as the data could be parsed through various other means.

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**

An instance where code was refactored to improve functionaility was when many of the header and footer code was converted into Handlebar partials to cut down significantly on the total amount of html code across the entire application. 
The benefit to this is that changes made to the header could be made to all pages at the same time instead of needing to update the header portion of several html files individually.

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**

Security is at the forefront of many full stack applications and the usage of methods and endpoints allow for greater control over security. Endpoints are locations in the API where a restricted amount of data could flow assuming the user has a valid authentication token. 
Methods allow the backend and frontend to pass information safely through the endpoints by obfuscating what is happening with the data being given and received inside the methods. 

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**

This course has helped me get a better understanding of what goes into Full Stack Development and has been very useful for learning JavaScript, a language I previously had no experience with. 
Learning how to use JavaScript and JSON actually became relevant in the middle of the semester as I was working on a personal project that benefited from the usage of parsing JSON files in Python. 
Learning how to use Node, Angular, and Express is also very helpful as these are all powerful tools that can offer a lot on future projects and in possible career paths.
